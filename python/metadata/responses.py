        The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A'A and AA' are related, but 
        they represent different aspects of the matrix. A'A is a square 
        symmetric matrix, so its eigenvalues are real and non-negative, and 
        its eigenvectors are orthogonal. AA' may not be square, so it 
        doesn't necessarily have real eigenvalues or orthogonal 
        eigenvectors.

        Whether you can invert matrix A depends on its properties. 
        If the matrix is square and has full rank (i.e., its rows and columns 
        are linearly independent), then you can invert it. To invert matrix A, 
        you can use methods like Gaussian elimination or matrix inversion 
        formulae.

        This calculation computes the pixel-wise difference between your face 
        and the average face, and then calculates the magnitude of that 
        difference vector. The resulting value represents the Euclidean 
        distance between the two faces.

        UMAP, which stands for Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, 
        is a dimensionality reduction technique that is commonly used for data 
        visualization and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. UMAP is based on 
        several mathematical principles:

        Manifold Learning: UMAP is built upon the idea of preserving the underlying 
        structure of data that often lies on or near a lower-dimensional manifold 
        within the high-dimensional space. This is similar to other dimensionality 
        reduction techniques like t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) 
        and PCA (Principal Component Analysis), but UMAP aims to capture both global 
        and local structures more effectively.

        Graph Theory: UMAP constructs a high-dimensional graph representation of the 
        data. In this graph, each data point is a node, and edges are created between 
        neighboring points. The concept of distance and similarity between data points 
        plays a crucial role in this step.

        Fuzzy Set Theory: UMAP uses fuzzy set membership functions to model the similarity
        between data points. It defines how closely two data points are related in terms 
        of their fuzzy set membership, which allows for a more flexible representation of 
        similarity compared to traditional distance metrics.

        Optimization: UMAP employs optimization techniques, specifically stochastic gradient 
        descent, to learn a low-dimensional representation of the data that best preserves 
        the fuzzy topological structure of the high-dimensional space. The optimization 
        process 
        minimizes a cost function that balances the preservation of global and local structure.

        Riemannian Geometry: UMAP also incorporates elements of Riemannian geometry to ensure 
        that the embedding is done in a way that respects the manifold's curvature.

        UMAP is useful for a variety of tasks, including:

        Data Visualization: UMAP is primarily used for visualizing high-dimensional data in a 
        lower-dimensional space (often 2D or 3D). It can reveal complex structures and clusters 
        in the data, making it easier to explore and interpret.

        Clustering Analysis: UMAP can help identify clusters and groupings within data, even 
        when these clusters have nonlinear or complex shapes.

        Feature Engineering: UMAP can be used for feature engineering by creating a lower-dimensional 
        representation of the data that retains important information. This can be beneficial for 
        downstream machine learning tasks.

        Anomaly Detection: UMAP can help in identifying anomalies or outliers by highlighting 
        data points that do not conform to the learned manifold structure.

        Data Preprocessing: UMAP can be used as a preprocessing step to reduce the dimensionality
        of data before applying other machine learning algorithms. This can lead to improved model performance and reduced computational complexity.
